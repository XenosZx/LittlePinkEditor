## Name
The name "LittlePinkEditor" was inspired by an already existing NSMB2 save editor, [BigRedEditor](https://github.com/ExplosBlue/BigRedEditor)

## Log

8/24 - Figured out where data for sun stones and level completion were located and succesfully was able to manipulate them
8/27 - Created main.cpp, gui.cpp, and save_editor.cpp, will start coding the application soon. (Note: I have not fully cracked the save structure for KTD, but am getting there.)
